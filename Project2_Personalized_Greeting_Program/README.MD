# Personalized Greeting Program 👋

This is a beginner-level Python mini-project designed as part of my learning journey (Project-2, Day-2).

## 📌 What does it do?

This program:
- Asks the user for their **name**, **age**, and **favourite color**
- Then displays a **personalized greeting message** using the user's input

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to take **user input** in Python using `input()`
- How to **store values in variables**
- Type casting using `int()` for numeric input
- Using **f-strings** for clean string formatting
- Printing clean and user-friendly messages
- A little bit of formatting like `\n` and emojis 😊

## 🖥️ Sample Output

What is Your Name :- Rohit
How Old Are You :- 19
What's Your Faviourate Color :- Blue

----Personalized Greeting Message ------------
Hello Rohit! 👋
Your are 19 Years old and Blue is a beautiful color
You are now ready to start your python learning journey 🥰



## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add more user prompts (hobbies, goals, etc.)
- Convert into a GUI version using `Tkinter`
- Save user data into a file or database (for practice)
