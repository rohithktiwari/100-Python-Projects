# 🔢 Project 3: Simple Calculator (Python)

## 📚 About the Project

This is a basic calculator program written in Python. It performs four arithmetic operations:
✅ Addition
✅ Subtraction
✅ Multiplication
✅ Division

The user is asked to input two numbers, and the program displays the result of each operation.

## 💻 Tech Used

* Python 3

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

* `input()` for user input
* Type conversion using `float()`
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* `if-else` condition to handle division by zero
* `print()` formatting with `f-strings`

---

## 📌 How it Works

1. The user enters **two numbers**.
2. The program calculates:

   * Sum
   * Difference
   * Product
   * Quotient
3. It prints the results neatly.
4. If the second number is `0`, it avoids division and shows a warning.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Enter your First Number :- 10
Enter Your Second Number :- 2
Addition of 10.0 + 2.0 =  12.0
Subtraction  of 10.0 + 2.0 = 8.0
Multiplication  of 10.0 + 2.0 = 20.0
Division  of 10.0 + 2.0 =  5.0
```

---

## ⚠️ Note

* The division part uses a conditional check:
  `print(...) if number_2 != 0 else "cannot divide by zero"`
  This prevents errors during division.
