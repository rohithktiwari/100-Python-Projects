# Project 1: Welcome Message Generator 👋

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple Python program that generates a personalized welcome message for the user. It's a great beginner-level project to get comfortable with user input, string formatting, and printing messages.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Taking input from the user using `input()`
- Using f-strings to create dynamic messages
- Writing clean and readable code

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter their name.
2. The program greets them with a customized welcome message.
3. That's it — small but powerful start!


## 🧠 Why I Chose This Project

I wanted to start with something simple but meaningful — a friendly way to begin my 100 Python Projects journey. This project helped me get familiar with how Python interacts with the user through the terminal.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Add time-based greetings (e.g., Good Morning, Good Evening)
- Store user names and create a log of messages
- Use GUI (Tkinter) version in future
