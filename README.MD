# 100 Python Projects 🚀

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository!

This repository is a part of my journey to master Python and build a strong portfolio for **internships, learning, and real-world practice**.

## 🔥 What's Inside

- 🧠 **100+ mini projects**, each inside its own folder
- 🛠️ Pure Python – beginner to intermediate level
- 📁 Each project has:
  - `main.py` (project code)
  - `readme.md` (explains what the project does)
  - `requirements.txt` (if needed)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

- ✅ Practice & improve Python skills
- ✅ Build real projects to strengthen logic and coding style
- ✅ Showcase work to future employers/internships
- ✅ Stay consistent and track my growth
